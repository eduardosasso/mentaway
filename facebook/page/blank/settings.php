<p>Hi <strong><?php echo $user->fullname ?></strong> welcome to Mentaway!</p>
<p>The first step to use Mentaway is to configure the services that you would like us to track.</p>
<p>Mentaway is a geo location service so if you add Twitter and Flickr don't forget to enable geolocation on them. You can see how to do it on our help section.</p>
<p>You are not obligated to add any services to use Mentaway. This step is optional.</p>
