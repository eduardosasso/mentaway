<p>Hi <strong><?php echo $user->fullname ?></strong> welcome to Mentaway.</p>
<p>The first step to use Mentaway is to configure the services that we would like to track</p>
<p>Mentaway is a geo location service so if you add Twitter and Flickr don't forget to enable geo location on them. You can see how to do it on the <a href="help">help</a> section.</p>
<p>You'r not obligated to add any services to use Mentaway. This step is optional.</p>
