				In mid 2010 we were planning a trip to California and my girlfriend (<a href="http://twitter.com/gismullr">@gismullr</a>) was thinking about writing a blog telling our experiences during the trip.
				That idea was nice, but as lazy as I am I thought to myself that I would rather be surfing and visiting places then sitting at a desk uploading photos and writing.
				That kept me thinking for a couple of days until in one of those rare moments of inspiration I came up with the concept of Mentaway, a service that would automatically track and organize your trips and also help friends and family to see places you have been, countries you visited...and a lot of other nice features.			
			</p>
			<p>
				The name Mentaway was chosen in honor to the Mentawai island, a surfer's paradise in Indonesia, a place that it's in my dreams for a long time and a destination we definitely want to go.
				We love traveling, in a perfect world we would be traveling year-round and that's why we built Mentaway, to help people that share this same love and also to achieve our year-round traveling dream.
